Social media
I have created a photo sharing application like Instagram.
In this app I have used firebase for backend.
When anyone like and comment on your post you get notifications and using firebase cloud messaging to handle notifications.
Somewhere using Threading to handle long process like uploading image and fetching all data from firebase.
